# VideoGameOnlineShop
A simple .NET-based console application that simulates an online video game shop, where users can browse, add games to a cart, and make purchases. This project aims to provide a basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and backend logic development using C#.
## Introduction
VideoGameOnlineShop is a console-based application built with .NET, designed to replicate the core functionalities of an online video game store. Users can browse through a selection of games, view game details, add games to their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout to make a purchase. The project serves as a learning platform for implementing backend logic in a structured and organized way while simulating real-world scenarios of an e-commerce application.
## Motivation
The motivation behind VideoGameOnlineShop is to provide a simple, yet practical, project for learning C# and .NET development. By creating a console-based online shop, aspiring developers can focus on understanding key concepts such as object-oriented programming, data flow, and application architecture without the distraction of a complex user interface. The project also serves as a playground for experimenting with code organization techniques, making it a valuable resource for those looking to strengthen their backend development skills.
## Features
- **Browse Game Catalog**: Users can view a list of available games, along with details such as price and description.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add selected games to a shopping cart for later purchase.
- **View Cart**: The contents of the shopping cart can be reviewed before making a purchase.
- **Checkout Process**: Simulates a checkout process where users confirm their order.
- **Remove from Cart**: Users can remove items from the cart if they change their mind.
## Technologies Used
- **.NET 6**: Built using the .NET 6 framework to leverage the latest features and improvements in C# development.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used to implement the application logic.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Demonstrates the use of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
